## Project Title and Overview 
We were inspired for the awesome name by the **Wonderful** ability of music to get under your skin and make your heart **Bang** harder! 
And as our web application allows users to create playlists with video and audio clips from multiple platforms we proudly call it a **DJ**. :headphones: 

## Purpose and Need 
As we :heart: music so much it was a real struggle for us to have to change platforms just so you could listen to certain songs. 
And haven't you ever had a thought like "Bang it! Why can't I combine songs into a playlist from more than one website?" 
Well, You're welcome! It's already possible! We are here to make your dream come true! 

## Business Divers and Significance 
Our passion for music and the constant switching between (mainly) Spotify, YouTube and Soundcloud inspired us to create this cool app. 
With our simple user interface we are making it easier then ever to create your own playlist and add songs to it just with one click! 

## Benefits and Costs :money_with_wings: 
 
Create a **free** account and you will be able to create unlimited custom private playlists. 
 
No need to struggle with a single platform anymore. 
 
(When we add public playlists) 
Sharing your taste in music with your friends will be more awesome then ever. 
 
And if you upgrade to Pro(Future development) you will also add pubic playlists to share with everyone just by copying a single link.
