## Project Title and Overview 
The name is inspired by the **Wonderful** ability of music to get under your skin and make your heart **Bang** harder! 
Our web application allows users to create playlists with video and audio clips from multiple platforms so we proudly call it a **DJ**. :headphones: 

## Purpose and Need 
As we :heart: music we found it annoying to have to change platforms to listen to particular songs. 
And haven't you ever had a thought like "Bang it! Why can't I combine songs into a playlist from more than one website?" 
Well, You're welcome! It's already possible! We are here to make your dream come true!


## Business Divers and Significance 
Our passion for music and the constant switching between (mainly) Spotify, YouTube and Soundcloud inspired us to create this cool app. 
With a simple user interface we are making it easier than ever to create a personalised playlist and add songs with just one click! 

## Benefits and Costs :money_with_wings: 
 
Make a **free** account to create unlimited custom private playlists. 
 
Use a single care-free platform.
